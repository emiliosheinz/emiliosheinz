## Hello 👋, I'm Emilio

As an experienced Software Engineer graduated with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science, I have been working on the development of applications that are daily accessed by thousands of users since 2019. I bring ideas to life, I turn coffee into code ☕️.

 - :computer: I’m currently working with Microfrontends built with React and Vue;
 - :heart_eyes: Passionate about education and open source projects;
 - :seedling: I’m currently learning more about Security through [Pato Academy](https://pato.academy/).
